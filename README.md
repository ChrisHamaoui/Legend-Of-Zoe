# Legend-Of-Zoe

This is a small personal project I worked on to practice my ability to implement and work with object oriented models.
It helped improve my abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism techniques.
It's played entirely in the terminal, which acts as a primitive graphical interface.
The goal is to acquire the piece of Hexaforce in each of the six levels without dying.

The & represents the player (Zoe).

The @ represents the monsters.

The $ represents the chests.

The E represents the exit portal.

COMMANDS

WASD to move.

O to open a chest.

C to dig in the walls.

X to attack the monsters.
